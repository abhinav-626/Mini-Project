# Mini-Project — Mental Health Care Bridge

Mini-Project is a web/mobile application prototype that connects people experiencing mental health issues with qualified mental health professionals. The goal is to make help easier to find by providing an accessible platform for screening, booking consultations, and starting conversations with professionals or peer-supporters.

## Key goals
- Reduce friction for users seeking mental health support.
- Provide an easy way to find and contact mental health professionals.
- Offer a private screening flow to triage needs and recommend next steps.
- Allow scheduling consultations, secure messaging (or chat), and resource sharing.

## Features (planned / implemented)
- User onboarding and profile creation
- Symptom screening / short questionnaire for triage
- Browse and filter mental health professionals
- Book appointments (calendar integration)
- Secure messaging or chat between user and professional
- Resources and self-help materials
- Admin interface for managing professionals and appointments

## How it works (high level)
1. User signs up and completes a brief screening questionnaire.
2. Based on answers, the system suggests self-help resources or recommends professional consultation.
3. User can browse professionals, view availability, and request/book an appointment.
4. After booking, users can message professionals and join scheduled sessions.
5. Admins / professionals can manage profiles, appointments, and respond to messages.

## Tech / Architecture (suggested)
- Frontend: React / Vue / Flutter (web or mobile)
- Backend: Node.js (Express) or Python (Django / Flask)
- Database: PostgreSQL / MySQL
- Authentication: JWT or OAuth
- Messaging: WebSockets (Socket.IO) or third-party chat API
- Deployment: Docker, Heroku, Vercel, or cloud provider

## Quick start — generic steps
Below are general steps to run the project locally. Replace commands with the actual ones used in this repository.

1. Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/abhinav-626/Mini-Project.git
   cd Mini-Project

2. Install dependencies
   - If Node.js:
     - npm install
     - or yarn install
   - If Python:
     - python -m venv venv
     - source venv/bin/activate
     - pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Configure environment
   - Create a .env file in the project root and add settings like:
     - DATABASE_URL
     - SECRET_KEY / JWT_SECRET
     - EMAIL / TWILIO / CHAT_SERVICE credentials (if used)

4. Database setup (if applicable)
   - Run migrations:
     - Node (example): npx sequelize db:migrate
     - Django: python manage.py migrate
   - Seed demo data (if a script exists).

5. Start the app
   - Node: npm start or npm run dev
   - Python: python manage.py runserver

6. Open your browser to http://localhost:3000 (or the port shown in the console).

## Usage / User flows (examples)
- New user: sign up → complete screening → view recommended professionals/resources → book appointment.
- Professional flow: create profile → set availability → accept or reject bookings → message clients.
- Admin flow: manage users, professionals, appointments, and site content.

## Testing
- Run unit and integration tests (if present):
  - npm test or python -m pytest
- Add tests for new features and user flows.
